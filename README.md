# sudoku_solver
In this program, I consider the problem of Sudoku. The program will generate a prolog program and then outputs the results.

Description of the data format: the puzzle description consists of 9 rows, each with 9 characters. The characters are digits (which means that a digit is entered in that place in the puzzle) and dots.

To run all tests: python validator.py --stdio zad4 python sudoku.py
